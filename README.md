# Sorting algorithms

### Idea of this project
While some could read a book and understand it easily, other might struggle to imagine
one or another aspect without visually looking at it.
I am a strong believer of the concept of the different learning styles. But more than often to learn something actually deep you would combine two or more styles.  

At the time I was creating this project and might be to this day there was lack of resources where one could observe the sorting algorithms in work and this inspired me to start this repository.
